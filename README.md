# SillyClick
An idle (incremental/clicker) game written because I love their silly pointlessness! ...but it will probably turn into an Empire Building game where you play at an ever increasing macro level.

# Goal 1
Make a window with a thing you can click and something to count how many clicks you have clicked.
