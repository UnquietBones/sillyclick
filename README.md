# SillyClick
An idle (incremental/clicker) game written because I love their silly pointlessness! ...but it will probably turn into an Empire Building game where you play at an ever increasing macro level.

# Goal 1 - Growing Carrots
You have one raised garden bed box.

When you click the button it will plant a carrot.

Every ten clicks is a full bed of carrots. 

Once the bed is full it starts a counter down to the carrots being ready to harvest.

When the box is ready to harvest it will wait for you to click on it.

You stockpile the carrots and sell the carrots.

You start out with one bed, but you can buy more beds.

You can buy upgrades to plant the carrots faster.

You can buy upgrades to have the carrots grow faster.

As you get further along, carrot growing hazards will start to appear.

Which leads you to the next level of the game...

# Goal 2 - Bunnies
