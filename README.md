# SillyClick
An idle (incremental/clicker) game written because I love their silly pointlessness! ...but it will probably turn into an Empire Building game where you play at an ever increasing macro level.

- Goal 1 : Make a window with a thing you can click and something to count how many clicks you have clicked.

# Goal 2
Make the apperance of Button 2 dependant on a threshold of Button 1 clicks. Make Button 2 clicks add to the Button 1 total as well as the Button 2 total.

# Goal 3
Find a way to do a timed repetative add to the Button 1 total based on how many Button 2 clicks have been made.

# Goal 4
Find a better way to make the UI, it's a little ugly right now (but it works!).
